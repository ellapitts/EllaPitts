# Hi there, I'm Ella Pitts! 👋

I'm a **MS in Computer Science** student at **Northeastern University** with a unique background in **Hispanic and Germanic Languages**. My goal is to leverage my foundation in languages and my technical skills in software engineering to build intuitive, human-centric applications in the AI/ML space. My area focus(es) are AI, Data Science, Machine Learning, NLP, and Software Engineering and I love solving complex problems to find a holistic, dynamic solution!

I am actively seeking a co-op or internship role from **May 2026 – Jan 2027**.

**A little more about me...**
My transition into technology comes from a background in foreign languages that     gives me a unique perspective on the intersection of human communication and technical innovation. This desire was sparked by witnessing firsthand the way communication has evolved and seeing the constant evolution of technology. I am driven by a desire to understand the holistic scope of a problem and thrive in open, collaborative team environments. My goal is to combine my technical skills with diverse perspectives to build technology that bridges the gap between people to be human centered.
